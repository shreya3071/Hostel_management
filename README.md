# Hostel-Management-System
A database management system designed using SQL Developer to efficiently organize and record information about college Hostels.

In this project, a database management system has been designed to organise and store information about college hostels. This database contains information about students, the rooms, hostels and messes they are assigned to, a visitor and student log etc. It also stores admin information and complaints that are lodged by the students. The main aim of this project is to efficiently store and retrieve student information. It's design helps facilitate convenient management of data, by computerizing most of the work and getting rid of manual entry and record systems.
